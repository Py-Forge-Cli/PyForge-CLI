# Claude Session Log - Databricks Tests Investigation and PySpark Version Update
**Date**: January 5, 2025
**Duration**: ~30 minutes
**Focus**: Investigating Databricks test requirements and updating PySpark version across project

## Session Overview
This session focused on investigating why Databricks tests were excluded from the main test suite and updating all project documentation and configuration to use the correct PySpark version (3.5.0) that's compatible with Databricks Serverless V1.


## Key Findings

### 1. Databricks Serverless V1 Environment
- **Python Version**: 3.10.12
- **Apache Spark Version**: 3.5.0 (from Databricks Runtime 14.3 LTS)
- **Key Libraries**:
  - pandas==1.5.3
  - pyarrow==8.0.0
  - numpy==1.23.5
  - pyspark==3.5.0
  - delta-spark==3.1.0

### 2. Version Compatibility Issues Discovered
- **Initial State**: Project was using PySpark 3.5.2 and 4.0.0 in different places
- **Problem**: PySpark 3.5.x typically requires pandas >= 2.0.0, but Databricks Serverless V1 uses pandas 1.5.3
- **Solution**: Standardized to PySpark 3.5.0 which works with pandas 1.5.3 (with deprecation warnings)

### 3. Test Execution Results
- Successfully installed PySpark 3.5.0 and delta-spark 3.1.0
- All 53 Databricks tests passed successfully
- Overall test results: 304 passed, 22 failed (89.7% pass rate)
- Code coverage improved from 33% to 46%

## Actions Taken

### 1. Investigation Phase
- Analyzed why Databricks tests were being excluded
- Discovered PySpark/Pandas version conflict was the root cause
- Found that Databricks Runtime 14.3 LTS uses Apache Spark 3.5.0
- Confirmed Python 3.10 is required for compatibility

### 2. Dependency Updates
- **Updated requirements-dev.txt**:
  - Changed from `pyspark>=3.4.0` to `pyspark==3.5.0`
  - Added `delta-spark==3.1.0`

- **Updated pyproject.toml**:
  - Changed all PySpark references from 3.5.2 to 3.5.0
  - Updated databricks optional dependencies
  - Updated test-pyspark dependency group
  - Added comments about Databricks Runtime 14.3 LTS compatibility

### 3. Script and Configuration Updates
- **Updated Makefile**:
  - Already configured to use Python 3.10 for test environment
  - Added comments about Databricks compatibility

- **Updated scripts/setup_dev_environment.py**:
  - Added Python version detection with warnings for 3.11+
  - Modified to prefer Python 3.10 when available
  - Added Java version info for PySpark 3.5.0
  - Updated .env template with PySpark version comments

### 4. Documentation Updates
- **Updated README.md**:
  - Added Python 3.10 recommendation for Databricks
  - Added PySpark 3.5.0 to requirements
  - Updated prerequisites section

- **Updated CONTRIBUTING.md**:
  - Added Python 3.10.12 recommendation
  - Added Java 8 or 11 requirement for PySpark
  - Updated test marker documentation

- **Updated docs/getting-started/development-setup.md**:
  - Added PySpark 3.5.0 compatibility notes
  - Updated Java settings with version requirements
  - Added note about PySpark installation

### 5. Constraints File Updates
- **Updated constraints-databricks-serverless-v1.txt**:
  - Added PySpark 3.5.0 and delta-spark 3.1.0
  - Added Apache Spark version to header comments

### 6. CI/CD Updates
- **Updated .github/workflows/pyspark-tests.yml**:
  - Changed spark-version from 3.5.2 to 3.5.0
  - Added comments about Databricks Runtime compatibility

### 7. New Documentation Created
- **Created docs/databricks-pyspark-compatibility.md**:
  - Comprehensive guide on Databricks and PySpark compatibility
  - Version requirements and setup instructions
  - Troubleshooting guide for common issues
  - Development tips and best practices

### 8. Existing Documentation Enhanced
- **Updated docs/api/extension-developer-guide.md**:
  - Added PySpark dependency example
  - Updated prerequisites to mention Python 3.10 and Java

- **Updated docs/databricks-serverless-compatibility-analysis.md**:
  - Added Apache Spark and PySpark version information
  - Updated both V1 and V2 specifications

## Test Results Summary
```
Total Tests: 339
Passed: 304 (including all 53 Databricks tests)
Failed: 22 (all in main CLI)
Skipped: 13
Pass Rate: 89.7%
Code Coverage: 46% (improved from 33%)
```

## Key Takeaways
1. **Databricks tests are now working** with PySpark 3.5.0
2. **Version compatibility is critical** - must use exact versions for Databricks
3. **Python 3.10 is required** for best compatibility with Databricks Serverless V1
4. **Documentation consistency** is important - updated all files to reflect correct versions
5. **Constraints files help** maintain version consistency across environments

## Next Steps Recommended
1. Consider fixing the remaining 22 failing tests to reach 90% pass rate
2. Update CI/CD pipelines to enforce Python 3.10 for Databricks tests
3. Consider creating a separate test environment specifically for Databricks
4. Monitor for any issues with the PySpark/Pandas version compatibility
