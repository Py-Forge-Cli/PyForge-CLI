## 📋 PRD REQUIREMENTS GATHERING

### 🎯 Problem Statement
<!-- What problem does this solve? Who experiences this problem? -->

The PyForge CLI tool currently lacks comprehensive test datasets for validation and testing of its file format conversion capabilities. Users and developers need access to diverse test datasets across different file formats (XML, MDF, DBF, MDB) and various file sizes to:
- Validate conversion accuracy and performance
- Test edge cases and file format variations
- Benchmark processing capabilities with different data sizes
- Ensure robust handling of real-world data scenarios

### 💡 Proposed Solution Overview
<!-- High-level description of your proposed solution -->

Create a comprehensive documentation feature that researches, collects, and organizes at least 5 test datasets for each supported file format (XML, MDF, DBF, MDB) across different data sizes:
- Small files (< 1MB)
- Medium files (1MB - 100MB) 
- Large files (100MB - 3GB)

This will include metadata documentation, data source attribution, and usage guidelines for each dataset.

### 👥 Target Users
<!-- Who will use this feature? What are their skill levels? -->

- **Primary Users**: Developers working on PyForge CLI
- **Secondary Users**: QA engineers testing file conversions
- **Tertiary Users**: End users wanting to validate tool capabilities
- **Skill Levels**: Technical users familiar with data formats and testing workflows

### 🔄 User Journey
<!-- Step-by-step workflow of how users will interact with this feature -->
1. User starts with: Need to test PyForge CLI with real-world data
2. User accesses: Documentation with curated test datasets
3. User downloads: Appropriate datasets for their testing needs
4. User runs: `pyforge convert [dataset] --format [target]`
5. User validates: Conversion results against expected outcomes
6. User can then: Report issues or validate successful conversions

### 📊 Requirements Breakdown
#### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Research and identify at least 5 datasets per file format (XML, MDF, DBF, MDB)
- [ ] Collect datasets across 3 size categories (small, medium, large up to 3GB)
- [ ] Document dataset metadata (source, size, characteristics, use cases)
- [ ] Create organized file structure for dataset storage/access
- [ ] Provide usage guidelines and testing scenarios

#### Non-Functional Requirements  
- [ ] **Performance**: Datasets should cover performance testing scenarios
- [ ] **Compatibility**: Include datasets from various sources/applications
- [ ] **Usability**: Clear documentation and easy access to datasets
- [ ] **Reliability**: Verify dataset integrity and licensing compliance

### 🖥️ Command Line Interface Design
```bash
# No new CLI commands - this is documentation/dataset collection
# Usage will be with existing commands:
pyforge convert test-datasets/xml/small/sample1.xml --format parquet
pyforge convert test-datasets/mdf/large/measurement_3gb.mdf --format csv
pyforge validate test-datasets/dbf/medium/database.dbf
```

### 📁 Input/Output Specifications
- **Input Types**: XML, MDF, DBF, MDB files from various sources
- **Output Types**: Documentation (markdown), dataset organization, metadata files
- **Processing Options**: Dataset categorization by size and complexity
- **Configuration**: Dataset access guidelines and usage instructions

### 🔍 Technical Architecture
- **Core Components**: 
  - Dataset research and collection process
  - Documentation structure under `/docs/test-datasets/`
  - Metadata tracking system
  - File organization hierarchy
- **Dependencies**: Access to public datasets, potential data licensing
- **Integration Points**: Links to existing converter testing workflows
- **Data Flow**: Research → Collection → Documentation → Validation → Publication

### 🧪 Testing Strategy
- **Dataset Validation**: Verify file format integrity and accessibility
- **Size Verification**: Confirm datasets meet size requirements per category
- **Format Coverage**: Ensure representation across format variations
- **Documentation Testing**: Validate all links and instructions work correctly
