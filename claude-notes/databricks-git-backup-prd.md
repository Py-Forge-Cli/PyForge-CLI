## 1. Executive Summary

This PRD outlines requirements for implementing an enterprise-scale Git-based backup solution for Databricks notebooks. The solution will replace the current volume-based backup system with a version-controlled approach using Azure DevOps, managing over 70,000 notebooks in a single Git repository with automated daily synchronization.

### Key Benefits
- **Version Control**: Full Git history with diff capabilities
- **Collaboration**: Team access through Azure DevOps
- **Compliance**: Audit trail and change tracking
- **Efficiency**: Incremental backups reduce time and storage
- **Recovery**: Point-in-time restoration capabilities

## 2. Problem Statement

### 2.1 Current Challenges

1. **No Version Control**: Current volume-based backups lack version history
2. **Limited Collaboration**: No ability to review changes or collaborate
3. **Storage Inefficiency**: Full backups consume excessive storage
4. **No Diff Capability**: Cannot compare versions or track changes
5. **Recovery Complexity**: Difficult to restore specific versions
6. **Scale Issues**: 70,000+ notebooks strain current system

### 2.2 Business Impact

- **Risk**: Potential data loss without proper version control
- **Compliance**: Difficulty meeting audit requirements
- **Productivity**: Time wasted on manual backup management
- **Cost**: Excessive storage costs for redundant backups
